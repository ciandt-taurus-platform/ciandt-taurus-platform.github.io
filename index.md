## What is a platform team

*[More details here](https://sites.google.com/ciandt.com/northatlantictecharea/tech/platform-team) - CI&T restricted site*

### Definition
An Internal Platform team is an evolution of the standard definition of a DevOps team.  It derives from the Team topologies concept and it is mainly responsible for providing a compelling internal product to accelerate delivery by Stream-aligned teams (Stream-aligned a.k.a teams that deliver directly to the business)

*"Not every platform team is automatically successful, but the successful ones treat their platform as a product. They strive to create a compelling value proposition for application teams that is easier and more cost-effective than building their own solutions."* (Puppet State of DevOps 2021)

### Objective
The main objective of a platform team is to improve the four most important DevOps metrics:

* Deployment frequency: number of deployments per period of time - Target:  as needed (> 1 per day)

* Lead time for delivery:  time-frame from the last commit to the production deployment - Target: < 60 minutes

* Mean time to recover (MTTR): time-frame from the issue identification to the production fix - Target: < 45 minutes

* Successful deployment rate: number of successful deployments per total deployments - Target: > 98%  

### Outcomes
The Internal Platform team should treat every other stream-aligned team as its client; therefore, the platform team should adopt a Product Engineering mindset and be prepared to create and implements solutions to compete against vendor-locked ones.  The products and solutions should be more efficient and cost-effective than its competition.

In addition, all services should be treated as much "self-service" as possible to allow for rapid and cost-free adoption and implementation.

### Main scope for a platform team
Accelerators (source code snippets, libraries, modules and etc)

CI/CD tools

Open source solution evaluation
